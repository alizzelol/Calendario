# CALENDARIO
## Introduction

This app is a personalized calendar that I've created for the company ADAE.
The company works with children who need help in their studies.
This app got two roles: admin and parents.

## Goals
The goals of this app is for the teachers of the company to be able load workshops and courses for the parents to know, so their children will be able to attend.
- The teachers can load the workshps and courses in a personalized calendar where they can see them by color and in the exact date.
- The parents, when they access the app, they can see the workshps and courses, they can sign up for the event of their choice.
- The teachers can take a look of the parents that have sign up for the course or workshop and know how many children they can expect.
This app is been created to decrease the time wasted for the teachers to announce when the courses and waorkshops will be to the parents.
